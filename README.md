# Stock Trader App - Vue.js

#### This application is an exercise I've undertaken to simulate a simple Stock Trading mechanism with Vue.js.

#### The App has been built with Vue.js, Vue Router and Vuex, with the assistance of Firebase for the db.

#### Here, we've used Bootstrap to ease our styling pressures to concentrate more heavily on the fundamentals of Vue and Vuex

##### The Home Screen - View your Funds
