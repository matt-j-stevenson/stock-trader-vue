# Stock Trader App - Vue.js

[Vue.js Docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)

### Run:

```javascript
    brew install yarn
    npm install npm@latest -g

    yarn serve
    npm run dev
```

##### This application is an exercise I've undertaken to simulate a simple Stock Trading mechanism with Vue.js. The App has been built with Vue.js, Vue Router and Vuex, with the assistance of Firebase for the Database management. Here, we've used Bootstrap (edited slightly) to ease our styling pressures to concentrate more heavily on the fundamentals of Vue and Vuex.

###### The Dashboard gives the user some tips on the app and how to go about getting started, whilst setting out a goal to achieve in a timeframe!
